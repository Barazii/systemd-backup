To learn system programming, building a device driver for hardware like a sensor or motor is a solid choice—it involves kernel modules, interrupts, I/O operations, and hardware interaction. However, it's complex and requires caution (e.g., avoid damaging hardware or systems). Alternatives include:
Writing a simple Linux kernel module (e.g., a character device driver).
Implementing a custom system call or modifying an existing one.
Developing a low-level system utility, like a custom scheduler or memory manager.
